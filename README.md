# Capstone 1: The Dog Wiki
The Dog Wiki is capstone project number 1, for Springboard, Jan 2022

The API used in this project is the open API called The Dog API, https://www.thedogapi.com/.

This website requires the user to register and be signed in to use.
Once signed in, the user can get information about any dog breed available in the database.

You can search for a specific breed by name, of if you're not sure about the breed's name you can narrow down your search by just entering a couple of characters.

You can also browse all available breeds, and see an overview of them all in a list, where you can choose one breed to see more information.

On the about breed page, you can learn everything you need to know before buying or adopting a dog. You will learn about their traits and temperament, their size and more.

If you just enjoy cute dogs but don't have a specific one in mind, you can fetch a random cute picture of a pup, and if you like it, why not learn more about it?

You will also find resources to take the final leap and buy or adopt your own pet, and everything you need to know to become an amazing dog parent!
